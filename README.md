#### Details 
Your API key is: 55f245758a054a6381d493b655144574






### Instructions

The purpose of this assessment is to complete a simple coding assignment. You are required to:

• Produce working, tested source code to solve the problem.
• Walk through your code with the assessor, answering questions on the code and design choices as requested by the assessor
• You are expected to work on this task on your own, without help or advice from others. If you need clarification on any aspect of the assessment.

### Task
• Get an API key for https://newsapi.org/
• Create a responsive web page that shows a feed of articles returned by the API. Include any data you think is relevant.
• Apply styles inspired by beta.spectator.co.uk, e.g. fonts, colors. We are not looking for a straight copy of the layout or stylesheet - just a similar overall look and feel.

#### What we are looking for
• Code written with a focus on teamwork. Other developers should be able to maintain and extend upon your project — we like simple code which follows good naming conventions and includes comments where necessary
• A good choice of tools for the job
• Semantic HTML
• Styles (vanilla CSS, SCSS, CSS-in-JS... whatever you like) that are easy to read, maintain, and build upon

#### Deliverables
• A responsive web page which is functional at any screen size
• The source code as a zip file or a link to a repository
• Source code must contain a README with instructions on running your project locally


#### Be prepared to talk about
• What you did, how you did it, and how long it took
• Talk about the tech stack and any libraries used in your project and why you chose them
Your design and code should meet these requirements and be sufficiently flexible to allow for future extensibility. Code should be well structured, suitably commented, have error handling and be tested.
